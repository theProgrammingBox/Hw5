Answer the following questions regarding STL and the 
vector container: 
1.  What is the STL? What is a vector? 
Answer: STL is a C++ library that provides a collection of
functions and classes that can be used to solve problems.
The vector container is a data structure that can be used to
store a collection of elements in a contiguous memory location.

2. Which vector operations change the size of a vector 
after its construction? 
Answer: The vector operations that change the size of a vector
after its construction are: push_back, pop_back, insert, erase,
resize, and clear.

3. What is the STL array container and how does it 
differ from the built-in array and from a vector? 
Answer: The STL array container is a data structure that can be
used to store a collection of elements in a contiguous memory
location. The STL array container differs from the built-in array
and from a vector because it has more features than the built-in
array but is not as flexible as the vector container because it
is not dynamic.

4. How does the vector member function resize() 
differ from reserve()? 
Answer: The vector member function resize() changes the size of
a vector to exactly the size specified by the argument. The vector
member function reserve() changes the size of a vector if it is 
greater than the current size.

5. What should begin() and end() do for a container? 
Answer: begin() returns an iterator to the first element in the
container. end() returns an iterator to the element after the
last element in the container.

6. Give an example of using the vector push_back() 
modifier. 
Answer: 
vector<int> v;
v.push_back(1);

/*
Write the following program using a vector: 
 
A common game is the lottery card. The card has 
numbered spots of which a certain number are selected 
at random. Write a Lotto() function that takes two 
arguments. The first should be the number of spots on a 
lottery card and the second should be the number of 
spots selected at random. The function should return a 
vector<int> object that contains, in sorted order, the 
numbers selected at random. Use your function as 
follows: 
 
Vector<int> winners; 
winners = Lotto(51,6); 

This would assign to winners a vector that contains six 
numbers selected randomly from the range 1 through 51. 
Note that simply using rand() doesnâ€™t quite do the job 
because it may produce duplicate values. Suggestion: 
Have the function create a vector that contains all the 
possible values, use random_shuffle(), and then use the 
beginning of the shuffled vector to obtain the values. 
Also write a short program that lets you test the 
function.
